# Julia Integer Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential integer overflow bug in a simple Julia function. The `myfunction` calculates the square of a number. However, if the input is a large positive integer, the result may exceed the maximum representable integer value, leading to incorrect results or errors.

The solution addresses this issue by using appropriate data types to handle potentially large numbers, ensuring that the calculation is performed without overflow.
